<p>DSSI is an API for writing audio plugins with custom user interfaces.
 Although designed for synthesis plugins, it can also be used for
 effects.  This document suggests a few reasons why you might want to
 consider using DSSI when writing synths or other plugins, or to
 consider adding DSSI support to a host application.

<div class="oddcontent"><a name="toc1"></a><h3>1. &nbsp;Synth authors</h3>

<p>If you're thinking of writing a synth, here are some reasons you might
 want to make it a DSSI plugin.
</p><ul>
<li>Flexibility

<br/><br/>   DSSI plugins can accept MIDI and audio input, can have any number
    of controls and audio outputs, can support unlimited string-based
    configuration values as well as the numeric control ports, and can
    provide their own user interface using any GUI toolkit.

<br/><br/>   Using DSSI does not limit your synth to being used as a plugin in
    sequencers that support DSSI, because the DSSI distribution also
    includes a complete, efficient JACK and ALSA-sequencer based host
    application.  This host will run a particular plugin automatically
    if invoked through a symbolic link -- so you can install your
    plugin in such a way as to be immediately operable as a standalone
    program as well, outwardly indistinguishable from any other
    JACK-based synth.

<br/><br/></li><li>Structure

<br/><br/>   DSSI separates the plugin and user interface, using standard Open
    Sound Control (OSC) messages to communicate between them.  This
    ensures that the plugin's controls are consistently externally
    available, provides a guarantee of automatability, and encourages
    clean plugin structure.

<br/><br/>   DSSI uses a parsed MIDI event structure to pass MIDI events to the
    plugin.  This removes the responsibility of parsing MIDI in the
    plugin, a common source of problems in VST instruments.

<br/><br/></li><li>Accessibility and control

<br/><br/>   A DSSI plugin can have any number of different user interfaces,
    which can be added at any time.  It's also possible to use the same
    user interface code for more than one different plugin.  DSSI user
    interfaces don't have to be graphical -- every DSSI plugin is
    naturally controllable, so can be used directly from external OSC
    control surfaces and other non-graphical interfaces.

<br/><br/>   DSSI also gives you a simple framework for basic requirements like
    mapping control ports onto MIDI controllers, so as to support MIDI
    controllers and MIDI automation as well as OSC and plugin port
    controls.

<br/><br/></li><li>Simplicity

<br/><br/>   Writing the plugin is easy -- the only hard part is that
    troublesome synthesis...

<br/><br/>   Plugins can very easily be written incrementally, creating and
    testing the synthesis engine first before adding any advanced
    features or user interface.  (Indeed there's absolutely no
    requirement to write a user interface at all.)  DSSI is based on
    LADSPA, and the simplest DSSI synth plugins are just like LADSPA
    plugins with a single extra function to accept incoming note
    events.

<br/><br/>   Source code to a number of plugins is available to serve as
    examples or bases for new efforts. The DSSI distribution itself
    contains several plugins, including the simplest-possible
    monophonic synth, a straightforward polyphonic synth, and
    monotimbral samplers. Also available are several softsynths
    (Xsynth-DSSI, hexter, Sineshaper, WhySynth), a FluidSynth wrapper
    (FluidSynth-DSSI), a DSSI-to-VST bridge (dssi-vst), an X-Y
    controller GUI (xy-controller-dssi), a libconvolve wrapper
    (dssi_convolve), and an oscilloscope (ll-scope) which
    demonstrates shared memory use between plugin and UI. Most of
    these plugins include GUIs, with Qt and GTK examples available.

<br/><br/></li><li>Clear host-neutral specification

<br/><br/>   DSSI has a written specification and an open, complete reference
    host.  It was designed and tested independently of implementation
    in any existing host.

<br/><br/>   One of DSSI's designers is an author of a sequencer that is also a
    DSSI host, but none of the other people behind DSSI even use that
    host, and DSSI was largely designed and tested in its own test
    framework before being implemented in it.  We're confident there
    are no hidden dependencies on any particular host.

<br/><br/>   The DSSI specifications also aim to reduce the amount of possible
    host dependency by specifying things like multithreading
    requirements, that usually go assumed in other APIs and end up
    causing portability problems.
</ul>
</div><div class="evencontent"><a name="toc2"></a><h3>2. &nbsp;Effects plugin authors</h3>

<p>DSSI plugins do not have to be synths.  DSSI is based on LADSPA 1.1,
 and is compatible with it.  This makes for some interesting
 possibilities.
</p><ul>
<li>Dual LADSPA and DSSI plugins

<br/><br/>   A single loadable object file can provide both LADSPA and DSSI
    plugins through the separate LADSPA and DSSI discovery mechanisms.
    You can exploit this to make the same or related plugin code
    available via both APIs, for example to provide an effects plugin
    that supports true presets when queried via DSSI but uses an
    additional control input to mimic presets if queried via LADSPA
    (which does not support presets explicitly).

<br/><br/></li><li>Custom GUIs for LADSPA plugins

<br/><br/>   The DSSI user interface standard consists of a set of guidelines
    for OSC message passing and user interface invocation.  Nothing
    about it is necessarily specific to DSSI plugins, although the
    standard does assume that the plugin has at least the structure of
    a LADSPA plugin.  You can take advantage of this to provide custom
    GUIs for standard LADSPA plugins.  This is actually very easy to
    do, and the resulting GUIs will work already in any host that
    supports both DSSI and LADSPA.
</ul>
</div><div class="oddcontent"><a name="toc3"></a><h3>3. &nbsp;Host authors</h3>

<p>Here are some good reasons to consider adding DSSI support to your
 sequencer or other plugin host application.
</p><ul>
<li>Appropriateness for plugin authors

<br/><br/>   Any plugin API needs to have more plugins than hosts.  The most
    important criterion for a host author is whether or not the API is
    a good one for writing plugins.  DSSI is, for all the reasons given
    above.

<br/><br/></li><li>Documented API and specification

<br/><br/>   DSSI is certainly more complex to implement for hosts than for
    plugins, and it's also more complex than some other synth APIs, but
    it's easier to get it right because almost everything is
    documented.  Contrast this with something like VST: a VST host can
    be a simpler thing than a DSSI host, but writing a VST host
    involves so much guesswork that it's hard to be sure whether any
    given plugin will actually run in it.

<br/><br/></li><li>Standard technology

<br/><br/>   DSSI's plugin interface is based on LADSPA and ALSA sequencer
    events, so any host that supports LADSPA, ALSA, and any form of
    synthesis will have most of the basics in place already.  The GUI
    part is more unusual, but all it really consists of is an external
    control interface for plugins using the industry standard OSC --
    which is a pretty good thing to have anyway.

<br/><br/></li><li>Best chance as a workable standard

<br/><br/>   The options for plugin synth support in a Free Software MIDI
    application are limited, and DSSI is the only one we know of that
    even has a written specification.  While there aren't very many
    DSSI plugins available at the time of writing -- hardly surprising,
    as it's still a new API -- DSSI is now supported by more hosts
    than any of the alternatives.

<br/><br/></li><li>Free VST support

<br/><br/>   The dssi-vst bridge plugin gives any DSSI host free support for
    Windows VST instruments and effects.

<br/><br/></li><li>Free LADSPA GUI support

<br/><br/>   Because DSSI is compatible with LADSPA, any DSSI implementation in
    an existing LADSPA host will get free support for custom LADSPA
    GUIs written to the DSSI GUI specification.  (See the "Effects
    plugin authors" section above.)
